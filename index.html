someone had snitched our secret
so before talk read the room
we should nab the blacksheep
so be awake.
and persue your dreams
my mom used to say don't lent others hand
it will regret your life
do your fonder job don't blame others 
make money be happy don't gringe others happiness
avialble solution of schedule making
don't be attention seeker
